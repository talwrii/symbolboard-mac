# symbolboard-mac

An ergonomic keyboard layout to:

* Make you independent of keyboards (avoid learning new symbol and modifier layouts)
* Allow using your pinky to press modifiers and the hand twisting related to it
* Ensure one can avoid pressing a key and a modifier with the same hand by mirroring bindings

This is achieved by moving the modifier keys onto the number keys (to avoid hand twisting) and providing two
new modifiers keys that can be used in conjunction with letters keys to insert symbols and provide
motions.

# Usage
